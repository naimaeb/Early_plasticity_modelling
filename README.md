# Early_plasticity_modelling
This repository contains two models for hippocampal early plasticity, code to analyse the simulation results, and figures.

The models build on two previous models of Calcium signalling: Li et al., (2012) and Xie et al., (2019).

The models can be found in the Models folder, both models are constructed in COPASI (Version 4.27). Model version 2 is an extension of the original but with a reaction for PP2B dephosphorylating AMPARs and PP1a and CaMKIIa common terms removed when acting on AMPARs.

The Simulation_analysis_code folder contains the Python (Version 3.7) code for analysing the results and producing the figures in the Figures folder.
